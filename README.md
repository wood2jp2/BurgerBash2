I created an app here that allows users (only those who love burgers), to re-create their favorites. They can add a burger to the menu, and eat (devour) at their pleasure. Once that occurs, the burger is taken off the menu and added to the eaten list. This app uses ORM / MVC framework file structure. Having little experience with this, this assignment was fairly tough, though I understood it more as I spent more time staring at the code. I used a Handlebars as a simple framework to display the burgers and data being manipulated. I had to add POST/PUT routes in order to add burgers to the list, as well as change the 'devoured' state of the burgers. The main idea here was passing the query functions up through various files (orm to burger to burgers_controller.js), and recalling those same functions with the correct parameters outlined (typically the table name, with any pertinent data such as the condition of the burger).

Tech Used: HTML, CSS / Bootstrap, Handlebars + various node packages, Express, Node.js
